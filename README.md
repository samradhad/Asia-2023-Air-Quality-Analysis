# Asia's 2023 Air Quality Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of air quality across Asian cities and countries for the year 2023. Using PM2.5 concentration as the primary indicator, the analysis identifies highly polluted regions, cleaner areas, seasonal trends and geographic pollution patterns.

The goal is to demonstrate data cleaning, aggregation, visualization and insight generation using Python.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Air Quality dataset (city-level data across Asia)
- **Metric Used:** PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³)
- Monthly PM2.5 values and annual averages are used for analysis.

---

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed
- Identification of **Top 10 most polluted cities** in Asia (2023)
- Identification of **Top 10 least polluted cities**
- **Monthly average PM2.5 trend** to study seasonality
- **Country-level aggregation** of air quality
- **Geographic visualization** of average AQI across Asia using a choropleth map

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- South Asian cities dominate the list of most polluted urban areas.
- Cleaner cities are mainly found in East and Southeast Asia.
- Air pollution exhibits strong seasonality, peaking during winter months.
- Country-level averages reveal regional disparities but may hide city-level extremes.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations
- Country-level averages may mask severe pollution in individual cities.
- The analysis is descriptive and exploratory; no predictive modeling is performed.
- Results depend on data availability and reporting consistency across regions.
